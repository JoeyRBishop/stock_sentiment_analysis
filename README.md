# stock_sentiment_analysis
This needs updating at a later date.

The idea of this project isw to see if one can use public tweets (twitter) to predict short term rises and falls in stock price (TSLA, as an itinial starting point).
I chose Tesla as it seems to be (from a breif analysis) a stock were there are a lot of "strong" options.
I will use sentiment analysis techquies to see if twitters consensus (feeling possitive or negative about Tesla) can be used to predict the change in tomorrows stock price.

The steps required to complete this project:
	Gather tweets (in english) that mention TSLA (I chose TSLA rather than Tesla for two reasons as TSLA will always mean the company and I feel like the ticker will be read by people who are active in the stock market).
	Gather historical price data of Telsa, so that we have a record of the price changes
	Use sentiemnt analysis to classify, tweets into possitive, negative and netural.
	Test to see if there is a correlation between price changes and tweets
